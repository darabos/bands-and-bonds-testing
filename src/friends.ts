The Xaranthian Empire is said to be ruled by wise engineers who built powerful machines to ease their work.
But building such machines is hard work too, so the Xarantians built factories to produce mechanical turtles
that can build machines that can deploy other machines that can grow further machines.

The Xaranthian factories in turn are built by Xaranthian Constructors. This one has never seen
a Xaranthian person, and neither has anyone else in your band.
